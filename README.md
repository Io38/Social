# Social
This is my own pet-project. It's a social media app.
You can edit your profile status, add posts, find users and watch their profiles, add them to a friend list or remove.
Login/logout feature was implemented as well.

To start the project use "npm install" and "npm start" or "yarn install" and "yarn start"
